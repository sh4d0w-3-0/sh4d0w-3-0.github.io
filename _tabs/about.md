_Hello_World_

# Introduction:

At the beggining of 2023 I've started the work in cybersecurity company. Since than I met a amazing people and face real cases that are not available for everyone before joining the world of cybersec.

Once upone a time, my collegue from the work told me that the great idea will be to write about our main achievements. The point of that is too make some kind of memory notes and portfolio for the future and aslo share the knowledge with others.

## Table of contents:

1. How offen I will be writting?
2. What topics will be covered?
3. PGP

### How offen I will be writting?

First of all, not regulary.

Secondly, when something interesting happen in my daily duties.

Thridly, I'm kind of man that like a free of will so, making some schedules will not work for me.

A little note for others from cybersec world - You may think that some of my posts are outdated - YES. It is done intentionally to avoid any direct correlations with what I do and for who.

### What topics will be covered?

The idea is to describe the most interesting cases with which I work and my personal growth of skills.
So, some of them will be investigations that I make in the cybersec and others will only describe my codding skills. I'm not making myself a strict boundaries too have a real freedom of writting.

### PGP

As has been stated in the introduction, one of the purposes of my writting is to creeate some kind of my portfolio that can help my in the future. So, to be sure that I'm in the real world the owner of this posts every commit will signed with my pgp.


### Summary

Enjoy the posts and I hope it will be interesting for You!
